charlotte: Wait,[pause=0.5] what?
charlotte: Why isnâ€™t there the usual lock?
charlotte: It changed...[pause=0.5] but who could have changed it?
charlotte: There are four colors\:[pause=0.5] blue,[pause=0.5] red,[pause=0.5] green and yellow.

charlotte: But I have no idea what that sequence might be...
charlotte: I must figure it out.
