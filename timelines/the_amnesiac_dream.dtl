[aa]Dear diary,[pause=0.5] today is December 15, 2024 and last night I dreamed of a man who called himself "The Amnesiac".
[aa]His face was blank—[pause=0.5]no eyes, no mouth, no nose—[pause=0.5]and he terrified me.
[aa]In that dream,[pause=0.5] I forgot...[pause=0.5] everything.
[aa][speed=10]Who is "The Amnesiac"?
